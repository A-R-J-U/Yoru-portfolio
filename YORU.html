    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

   <h3>
    A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Kiritani Ryo (Japanese: 桐谷 諒) is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. 
    Specifically interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him to Kingdom's S22 container port. On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask from a set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. 
    He was later recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru", and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw him returning there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by hostiles from Omega Earth.
